Added SdFatTestSuite and fixed bugs found by test programs.

Added functions:

bool SdFat::truncate(const char* path, uint32_t length); 

int16_t SdFile::fgets(char* str, int16_t num, char* delim);

11 May 2011

Added QuickStart sketch and QuickStart.txt file for fast hardware test.

Added several new examples.

Version of ls() that can write to any Print object.

New functions including freeClusterCount(), openNext() rename().

14 Apr 2011

Total rewrite to add iostreams and SdFat class with current working directory.
Old API maintained for backward compatibility.


27 Nov 2010


Added experimental support for FAT12.  This can be enabled by setting
FAT12_SUPPORT nonzero in SdFatConfig.h.

Added an experimental sketch, SdFatFormatter.pde, to format SD cards as
FAT16 and SDHC cards as FAT32.  See SdFat/examples/SdFormatter.

The return type of SdVolume::cacheClear was changed to cache_t*.

Many internal changes to support FAT12 and formatting SD/SDHC cards.


10 Oct 2010

Added Mega 2560.

Fixed rmRfStar() bug.

Fixed Sanguino NULL definition.

18 Aug 2010

Optimized write() for append at end of file.  Up to 50% faster sequential write.

13 Aug 2010

Added the following function to allow the SD chip select pin to be set
at runtime.  Warning - if the hardware SS pin is not used as chip select, 
the hardware SS pin will be set to output mode by init(). An avr processor
will not function as an SPI master unless SS is set to output mode.

uint8_t Sd2Card::init(uint8_t sckRateID, uint8_t chipSelectPin);

Added more SPI clock rate choices.  The above init() function and 
uint8_t Sd2Card::init(uint8_t sckRateID) call the new function 
uint8_t Sd2Card::setSckRate(uint8_t sckRateID).

setSckRate() sets the SPI clock rate to F_CPU/pow(2, 1 + sckRateID).
On an 16 MHz cpu this ranges from 8 MHz for sckRateId = 0 to 125 kHz
for sckRateID = 6.  This function must be called after the init() call.

Modified most examples to call card.init(SPI_HALF_SPEED) to avoid SPI bus
errors with breadboards and jumpers.  This sets the SPI speed to F_CPU/4.
Defined SPI_FULL_SPEED so init(SPI_FULL_SPEED) sets the SPI speed to F_CPU/2.

Added the following  function to cancel date/time callback. This function
must now be used instead of dateTimeCallback(NULL).

static void SdFat::dateTimeCallbackCancel(void);


The following member functions have been added for users who wish to avoid
calls to functions with non-const references.

uint8_t SdFile::contiguousRange(uint32_t* bgnBlock, uint32_t* endBlock);
uint8_t SdFile::createContiguous(SdFile* dirFile,
  const char* fileName, uint32_t size);
static void SdFile::dateTimeCallback(
  void (*dateTime)(uint16_t* date, uint16_t* time));
uint8_t SdFile::dirEntry(dir_t* dir);
uint8_t SdFile::makeDir(SdFile* dir, const char* dirName);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile* dirFile, const char* fileName, uint8_t oflag);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile* dirFile, const char* fileName);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile* dirFile, uint16_t index, uint8_t oflag);
uint8_t SdFile::openRoot(SdVolume* vol);
int8_t SdFile::readDir(dir_t* dir);
static uint8_t remove(SdFile* dirFile, const char* fileName);
uint8_t SdVolume::init(Sd2Card* dev);
uint8_t SdVolume::init(Sd2Card* dev, uint8_t part);

The following member functions have been marked as deprecated since they
are now wrappers for the new functions. dateTimeCallback is the only wrapper
with extra overhead.  The other wrappers are squeezed out by the complier.
These wrappers will be maintained in the future for backward compatibility.

uint8_t SdFile::contiguousRange(uint32_t& bgnBlock, uint32_t& endBlock);
uint8_t SdFile::createContiguous(SdFile& dirFile,
  const char* fileName, uint32_t size);
static void SdFile::dateTimeCallback(
  void (*dateTime)(uint16_t& date, uint16_t& time));
uint8_t SdFile::dirEntry(dir_t& dir);
uint8_t SdFile::makeDir(SdFile& dir, const char* dirName);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile& dirFile, const char* fileName, uint8_t oflag);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile& dirFile, const char* fileName);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile& dirFile, uint16_t index, uint8_t oflag);
uint8_t SdFile::openRoot(SdVolume& vol);
int8_t SdFile::readDir(dir_t& dir);
static uint8_t remove(SdFile& dirFile, const char* fileName);
uint8_t SdVolume::init(Sd2Card& dev);
uint8_t SdVolume::init(Sd2Card& dev, uint8_t part);

The deprecated function can be disabled by editing SdFat.h and setting
#define ALLOW_DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS 0

Fixed file modify time for file rewrite.

Major internal cleanup/reformat based on Google cpplint.py code style.

New Sd2Card::init() algorithm.

New SdFatInfo sketch for modified SdReadData() and other internal changes.

Modified examples to eliminate deprecated functions.

11 Jun 2010
Added definitions for Teensy to ArduinoPins.h (Paul Stoffregen)

Added troubleshooting.txt


23 Dec 2009

Added Software SPI capability.  See Sd2Card.h

Defining MEGA_SOFT_SPI allows an unmodified Adafruit GPS Shield to be used
on Mega Arduinos.  Software SPI works well with GPS Shield V1.1 
but many SD cards will fail with GPS Shield V1.0.

Added file ArduinoPins.h for pin definitions.

More error printout in examples.


25 Nov 2009

Added new functions for SdFile class:

dateTimeCallback(), dirEntry(), isRoot(), isSubDir, ls(), 
makeDir(), printDirName(), printFatDate(), printFatTime(), 
printTwoDigits(), rmDir(), and rmRStar().

Added new examples to test and illustrate use of new functions.

Removed sdCard() from SdFile class.

Fixed several bugs.




12 Nov 2009

Major rewrite of the version of SdFat that was included with
the WaveRP library.  

This is a preview that is being released to obtain comments
from several colleagues and future users.
