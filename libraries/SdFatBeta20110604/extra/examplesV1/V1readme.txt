These are examples from SdFat V1 for compatibility tests.

All except SdFatRawWrite compiled without change.

SdFatRawWrite needed a (uint8_t*) cast on this line:

  uint8_t* pCache = (uint8_t*)volume.cacheClear();


All of these examples could be simplified by using new features of SdFat.


SdFatAnalogLogger.pde - A simple data logger for one or more analog
                        pins.

SdFatAppend.pde - This sketch creates a large file by successive
                  open/write/close operations using O_APPEND.

SdFatBench.pde - A read/write benchmark.

SdFatCopy.pde - Copy the file created by SdFatAppend.pde to the file
                ACOPY.TXT.

SdFatGPS_CSVSensorLogger.pde - Ladyada's GPS logger modified to use the
                               SdFat library.

SdFatGPSLogger_v3.pde - Ladyada's GPS logger modified to use the SdFat
                        library.

SdFatLs.pde - A test of the ls() file list function.

SdFatMakeDir.pde - A debug sketch to verify subdirectory creation and
                   access.

SdFatPrint.pde - This sketch shows how to use the Arduino Print class
                 with SdFat.

SdFatRawWrite.pde - A test of raw write functions for contiguous files.

SdFatRead.pde  - This sketch reads and prints the file PRINT00.TXT
                 created by SdFatPrint.pde or WRITE00.TXT created by
                 SdFatWrite.pde.

SdFatRemove.pde - This sketch shows how to use remove() to delete the
                  file created by the SdFatAppend.pde example.

SdFatRewrite.pde - This sketch shows how to rewrite part of a line in
                   the middle of the file created by the
                   SdFatAppend.pde example.

SdFatRmDir.pde - A sketch to test file and directory deletion.


SdFatTail.pde  - This sketch reads and prints the tail of all files
                 created by SdFatAppend.pde, SdFatPrint.pde, and
                 SdFatWrite.pde.

SdFAtTimestamp.pde - This sketch shows how to set file access, create,
                     and write/modify timestamps.

SdFatTruncate.pde - This sketch shows how to use truncate() to remove
                    the last half of the file created by the
                    SdFatAppend.pde example.

SdFatWrite.pde - This sketch creates a new file and writes 100 lines
                 to the file.
