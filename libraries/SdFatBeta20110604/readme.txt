For those who don't like too much documentation read QuickStart.txt
then come back here.

The Arduino SdFat library provides read/write access to FAT16/FAT32
file systems on SD/SDHC flash cards.

To use this library place the uncompressed SdFat folder into the 
libraries subfolder in your main sketches folder.  You may need to
create the libraries folder.  Restart the Arduino IDE if it was open.

SdFat assumes chip select for the SD card is the hardware SS pin.  On a
168/328 Arduino this is pin 10 and on a Mega this is pin 53.  If you are
using another pin for chip select you will need call
Sd2Card::init(sckRateID, chipSelectPin) with second parameter set to the
chip select pin.  

If you have a shield like the SparkFun shield that uses pin 8 for chip
select you would change the line:
  sd.init(SPI_HALF_SPEED);
to
  sd.init(SPI_HALF_SPEED, 8);
  
If the example uses
  sd.init();
change it to:
  sd.init(SPI_FULL_SPEED, 8);


You can also edit Sd2Card.h and change the default value for chip select.
Replace SS_PIN with the new value for chip select in the following definition.

/** The default chip select pin for the SD card is SS. */
uint8_t const SD_CHIP_SELECT_PIN = SS_PIN;

Read changes.txt if you have used previous releases of this library.

Read troubleshooting.txt for common hardware problems.

Please read the html documentation for this library.  Start with
html/index.html and read the Main Page.  Next go to the Classes tab and
read the documentation for the classes SdFat, SdFile, ifstream, ofstream.

The SdFile class implements binary files simular to Linux's stdio.

The new classes ifstream, ofstream, istream, and ostream follow the
C++ iostream standard when possible.

Many examples are included in the SdFat/examples folder.

There are many tutorials and much documentation about using C++ iostreams.

http://www.cplusplus.com/  is a good C++ site.

Arduinos access SD cards using the cards SPI protocol.  PCs, Macs, and
most consumer devices use the 4-bit parallel SD protocol.  A card that
functions well on A PC or Mac may not work well on the Arduino.

Most cards have good SPI read performance but cards vary widely in SPI
write performance.  Write performance is limited by how efficiently the
card manages internal erase/remapping operations.  The Arduino cannot
optimize writes to reduce erase operations because of its limited RAM.

SanDisk cards generally have good write performance.  They seem to have
more internal RAM buffering than other cards and therefore can limit
the number of flash erase operations that the Arduino forces due to its
limited RAM.


The hardware interface to the SD card should not use a resistor based
level shifter.  SdFat sets the SPI bus frequency to 8 MHz which results
in signal rise times that are too slow for the edge detectors in many
newer SD card controllers when resistor voltage dividers are used.

The 5 to 3.3 V level shifter for 5 V arduinos should be IC based like
the 74HC4050N based circuit shown in the file SdLevel.png.  The
Adafruit Wave Shield uses a 74AHC125N.  Gravitech sells SD and MicroSD
Card Adapters based on the 74LCX245.

If you are using a resistor based level shifter and are having problems
try setting the SPI bus frequency to 4 MHz. This can be done by using
card.init(SPI_HALF_SPEED) to initialize the SD card.

A feature to use software SPI is available.  Software SPI is slower
than hardware SPI but allows any digital pins to be used.  See
SdFatConfig.h for software SPI definitions.

An unmodified Adafruit GPS shield can be use on an Arduino Mega
by defining MEGA_SOFT_SPI in SdFatConfig.h.


This library was designed to be used on 328 Arduinos but smaller
applications can be written for 168 Arduinos.  This library compiles
for the Mega Arduino but has not been thoroughly tested.

For the AtMega168 be sure to reduce the serial buffer size by setting 
RX_BUFFER_SIZE to 32 or less in
hardware/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.cpp.
I use 16.


The best way to restore an SD card's format is to use SDFormatter
which can be downloaded from:

http://www.sdcard.org/consumers/formatter/

SDFormatter aligns flash erase boundaries with file
system structures which reduces write latency and file system overhead.

SDFormatter does not have an option for FAT type so it may format
small cards as FAT12.

The example sketch SdFatFormatter.pde will format smaller cards FAT16
so they can be used with SdFat.

The SdFat/examples directory has the following sketches.  Older examples
are in the extras/examplesV1 folder.

AnalogLogger.pde - A simple data logger for one or more analog pins.

append.pde - This sketch creates a large file by successive
             open/write/close operations.

average.pde - A demonstration of parsing floating point numbers

bench.pde - A read/write benchmark.

bufstream.pde - ibufsteam to parse a line and obufstream to format a line

OpenNext.pde - Open all files in the root dir and print their filename

QuickStart.pde - A sketch to quickly test your SD card and SD shield/module

readlog.pde - Read file. Demo of pathnames and current working directory

ReadWriteSdFat - SdFat version of Arduino SD ReadWrite example

rename.pde - A demo of SdFat::rename(old, new) and SdFile::rename(dirFile, newPath)

SdFormatter - This sketch will format an SD or SDHC card.

To access these examples from the Arduino development environment
go to:  File -> Examples -> SdFat -> <Sketch Name>

Compile, upload to your Arduino and click on Serial Monitor to run
the example.
