Release notes for Time and TimeAlarm libraries 

Changes made July 22 2011:

This release provides a fix for recurring weekly alarms.

TheTime library is unchanged except for fixes to a macro in Time.h that
converts the number of days to elapsed seconds and the macros that are used
to calculate weekly alarms.

The functionality of the TimeAlarms library has changed slightly in order to
make the library easier to maintain and enhance.

In short, if your application used one of the Alarm methods to create weekly
alarms then you should change your sketch  to use the methods that take the
explicit DayOfWeek parameter. Only the Alarm methods are affected,
Timer methods are as before.

Here are the details:
The previous version could set weekly alarms by calling the AlarmOnce method
with a value greater than one day to indicate the day and time of the weekly
alarm. This has changed and explicit calls to set weekly alarms must be used
when setting weekly alarms. If you were setting weekly alarms by calling either
   Alarm.alarmRepeat(weeklyValue,  AlarmFunction);
then you need to change this to:
  arm.alarmRepeat(DayOfWeek, Hour, Minute, Second,  AlarmFunction);
  
Also the clock must be set to a time on or after Jan1 1971 when using the Alarm methods.
Timer methods are unchanged and will function even if the clock has not been set

Please report problems or suggestions in the forums.
